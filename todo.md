# TB1 - Task list
This document is intended to track feature expansions and bugfixes for the TB1 project.

## Feature Expansions
List of features that should be added or expanded upon.

### Keyboard playing
The synth should be playable from the computer keyboard. Notes should preferably be mapped in the same way as the "musical keyboard" in Logic Pro.

### Update filter type
Add a more advanced filter type. This could be an MS20 style filter or some sort of Moog style ladder filter perhaps.

### GUI rework
The GUI is getting crowded and can be improved.

### Click-and-hold playback mode
Notes played only when the mouse is clicking them, rather than toggling.

### Polyphonic mode
Add a mode for polyphonic playing.

### ARP modes
Currently notes are being played in the order they have been selected. The following modes should be added:
- Up
- Down
- Up/Down
- Random (?)

## Bugs
List of known bugs that need to be addressed.

### Resonance is barely noticable
Confirm that resonance is working as intended. Currently there is a barely noticable change when moving the resonance slider.
