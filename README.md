# TB1 - *"It sounds like crap!"*

This is a sort of *vibe code-y* project for me to learn a bit more about digital signal processing and building audio applications.

The following dependencies are required to build the project:
* PortAudio - For dealing with generating audio.
* Raylib / Raygui - Only really used for drawing the GUI.
